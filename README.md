# Bash- Menu to control remoted host./SSH/Remote Command/VMtools
Hello,

In this script you will define keys between you and your remoted host so typing the password is not neccesarry any more.

The second option of the utility will allow you to run a single command on the remote host without login into the server.

The third option will open an SSH session to the remote host abd by the "exit" command you will return to your base host.

The fourth option will reopen this session in order to allow you to control a diffrent host without exit the program.

Thanks,
Aharon Nadav
